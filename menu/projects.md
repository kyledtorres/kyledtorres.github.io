Here are some of my projects:

### TidyTuesday
TidyTuesday is a weekly data project organized by the R4DS Online Learning Community. Each week a new dataset is posted, giving users the opportunity to explore data from a variety of different disciplines. In this project, I practice tidying data as well as creating visualizations that effectively communicate relationships found in the data.
